       <h2>Kathryn McClintock</h2>

        <p>
          Kathryn McClintock is a design-oriented front-end developer. She strives to build immersive and beautiful web applications through carefully crafted code and user-centric design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since graduating with a B.A. in Communication from Trinity University in 2007, Kathryn has focused her professional career almost exclusively on Drupal development.
        </p>
        <p>
          She is the Team Lead for Amazee Labs Austin and specializes in Drupal's front-end. Kathryn is especially interested in Sass, Twig, and Styled Components.
        </p>
          In addition to her development work, Kathryn is a long-time member of the North American DrupalCon Program Team and has served on the front-end track for Austin ('14), Los Angeles ('15), New Orleans ('16), and Baltimore ('17).
        <p>
        <p>
          When not online, Kathryn can be found in Austin, Texas with her husband, Andrew — searching for the perfect vintage items for their home, trying out a new recipe in the kitchen, experimenting in gardening, or snuggling with their two dogs, Jackson and Pan.
